PhunGraf
========
PhunGraf is simply a play on "FunGraph." I was inspired to create this little side project after seeing a few just like it. Unfortunately, I don't have a link to the source of my inspiration, but I'm sure they weren't the first to make something like this either.

This is a nice little randomly generated graph that is slowly animated using HTML5 canvas. Number of nodes is dependent on window area. Node position, speed, and direction are randomized. Edges between nodes appear when two nodes are in between a random threshold.

As of now, there's no practical use for this, besides it potentially acting as an interesting background.
